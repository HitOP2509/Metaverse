          <br></br>
          <p>
            We use Razorpay for processing payments. We/Razorpay do not store
            your card data on their servers. The data is encrypted through the
            Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS) when
            processing payment. Your purchase transaction data is only used as
            long as is necessary to complete your purchase transaction. After
            that is complete, your purchase transaction information is not
            saved. Our payment gateway adheres to the standards set by PCI-DSS
            as managed by the PCI Security Standards Council, which is a joint
            effort of brands like Visa, MasterCard, American Express, and
            Discover. PCI-DSS requirements help ensure the secure handling of
            credit card information by our store and its service providers. For
            more insight, you may also want to read the terms and conditions of

          <br></br>
          <p>
            In general, the third-party providers used by us will only collect,
            use, and disclose your information to the extent necessary to allow
            them to perform the services they provide to us. However, certain
            third-party service providers, such as payment gateways and other
            payment transaction processors, have their own privacy policies with
            respect to the information we are required to provide to them for
            your purchase-related transactions. For these providers, we

            be located in or have facilities that are located in a different
            jurisdiction than either you or us. So if you elect to proceed with
            a transaction that involves the services of a third-party service
            provider, then your information may become subject to the laws of
            the jurisdiction(s) in which that service provider or its facilities
            are located. Once you leave our website or are redirected to a
            third-party website or application, you are no longer governed by
